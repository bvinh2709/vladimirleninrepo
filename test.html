      <p>This is my test page.</p>
      <p>I'm using it to test my uploads.</p>
      <p>My name is Vinh and I am a Vietnamese. I came to the United States in 2014. In 2015, I moved to Dallas from LA after living there for a year and a half. I like Texas a lot because pace of life is so much slower here, and the cost of living is twice as low as that in California. My major is Computer Science and I plan on completing by next summer. I am enrolled in five courses this semester to cut up time and this class is in the core curricumlum. I have never had any experience in creating a website before, so this class will be my first hands-on experience. Besides school, I am working at the Kickin' Crab in Carrollton. It is a cool place to enjoy some crab legs and crawfish if you like seafood. In my free time, I like listening to music, watching TV shows, reading mangas, and cooking.</p>
