                        <dt id="placeofbirth">Place of Birth</dt>
                        <dd>Vladimir Lenin was born in the city of Simbirsk in the Russian Empire on April 22, 1870.</dd>
                        
                        <dt id="realname">Real Name</dt>
                        <dd>Born Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, Lenin tried out a number of pseudonyms, including "K. Tulin" and "Petrov," prior to settling on "Lenin" by 1902. Historians believe it may have been a reference to the Lena River in Siberia. Other Russian revolutionaries likewise used pseudonyms, in part to confuse the authorities. Joseph Stalin's birth name, for example, was Iosif Dzhugashvili, and Leon Trotsky's was Lev Bronshtein.</dd>

                        <dt id="education">Education</dt>
                        <dd>Lenin studied law at Kazan University but was expelled after just three months. In spite of this, he achieved top ranking in law examinations and was awarded a law degree in 1891.</dd>
                        
                        <dt id="marriage">Marriage</dt>
                        <dd>Lenin married Nadezhda Krupskaya on July 22, 1898. Krupskaya served as Lenin's personal secretary and played a key organizational role in the socialist revolutionary group that became the Russian Communist Party.</dd>
                        
                        <dt id="imprisonment">Exile and Imprisonment</dt>
                        <dd>Lenin published his first Marxist essay in 1894, and the following year he traveled to France, Germany and Switzerland in order to meet with like-minded revolutionaries. Upon returning to Russia, he was arrested while working on the inaugural issue of a Marxist newspaper. He then spent over a year in jail prior to being sent off to Siberia, where he married a fellow exile and purportedly passed the time taking long walks, writing, hunting and swimming. Following the completion of his sentence in 1900, Lenin received government permission to leave the country. He remained abroad for most of the next 17 years, coming back only briefly during a failed revolutionary uprising in 1905.</dd>
                        
                        <dt id="role">Role</dt>
                        <dd>As founder of the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and leader of the Bolshevik coup d'état (1917), Vladimir Lenin created the Soviet Union. Along with Karl Marx, Lenin created the communist worldview.</dd>
                        
                        <dt id="stalin">Stalin</dt>
                        <dd>Stalin, a close member of Lenin's inner circle, became general secretary of the Communist Party in April 1922. Soon after, Lenin began to regret that appointment. In a letter to Russia's congress, penned in December 1922 and January 1923 but not read until after his death, he described Stalin as "too rude." "This failing … becomes intolerable in the office of general secretary," he wrote, adding that Stalin should be replaced with someone "more patient, more loyal, more respectful and more attentive to his comrades, less capricious and so on." In a separate letter, Lenin accused Stalin of having "the gall to call my wife to the telephone and abuse her." Around that time, however, Lenin suffered a third stroke that left him essentially unable to speak. Stalin went on to win a vicious power struggle to succeed Lenin and become one of the 20th century's most notorious dictators.</dd>
                        
                        <dt id="death">Death and Funeral</dt>
                        <dd>In 1918, Lenin was shot in an assassination attempt. Although he survived, his health was never good again. Starting in 1922, he suffered several strokes. He finally died from a stroke on January 21, 1924.</dd>
