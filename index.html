                <h2>About Vladimir Lenin</h2>
                <p class="text2">Vladimir Lenin, or <strong>Vladimir llyich Ulyanov</strong>, was a Russian revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He served as the first and founding head of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924 and of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia, and later the Soviet Union, became a one-party socialist state governed by the Communist Party. Ideologically a Marxist, his developments to the ideology are called Leninism.</p>
                <p class="text2">Born to an upper-middle-class family in Simbirsk, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brother's 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empire's Tsarist government, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye in Siberia for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in the RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martov's Mensheviks. Following Russia's failed Revolution of 1905, he campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europe-wide proletarian revolution, which, as a Marxist, he believed would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted the Tsar and established a Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.</p>

                <h2>Political Ideology</h2>
                <h3>Marxism and Leninism</h3>
                <p class="text2"><strong>Lenin was a devout Marxist</strong>, and believed that his interpretation of Marxism, first termed Leninism by Martov in 1904, was the sole authentic and orthodox one. According to his Marxist perspective, humanity would eventually reach pure communism, becoming a stateless, classless, egalitarian society of workers who were free from exploitation and alienation, controlled their own destiny, and abided by the rule from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. According to Volkogonov, Lenin deeply and sincerely believed that the path he was setting Russia on would ultimately lead to the establishment of this communist society.</p>
                <p class="text2">Lenin's Marxist beliefs led him to the view that society could not transform directly from its present state to communism, but must first enter a period of socialism, and so his main concern was how to convert Russia into a socialist society. To do so, he believed that a dictatorship of the proletariat was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy. He defined socialism as 3an order of civilized co-operators in which the means of production are socially owned, and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a society of abundance. To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with all citizens becoming hired employees of the state in his words. Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and statist, with both production and distribution strictly controlled. He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join to enable the state's economic and political centralisation. In this way, his calls for workers' control of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a workers' state. This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.</p>

                <h2>Democracy and the national question</h2>
                <p class="text2">Lenin believed that the representative democracy of capitalist countries gave the illusion of democracy while maintaining the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie; describing the representative democratic system of the United States, he referred to the spectacular and meaningless duels between two bourgeois parties, both of whom were led by astute multimillionaires that exploited the American proletariat. He opposed liberalism, exhibiting a general antipathy toward liberty as a value,and believing that liberalism's freedoms were fraudulent because it did not free labourers from capitalist exploitation.</p>
                <p class="text2">Lenin was an internationalist and a keen supporter of world revolution, deeming national borders to be an outdated concept and nationalism a distraction from class struggle. He believed that in a socialist society, the world's nations would inevitably merge and result in a single world government. He believed that this socialist state would need to be a centralised, unitary one, and regarded federalism as a bourgeois concept. In his writings, Lenin espoused anti-imperialist ideas and stated that all nations deserved the right of self-determination. He supported wars of national liberation, accepting that such conflicts might be necessary for a minority group to break away from a socialist state, because socialist states are not holy or insured against mistakes or weaknesses.</p>
                <h3>Personal life and characteristics</h3>
                <p class="text2">Lenin saw himself as a man of destiny and firmly believed in the righteousness of his cause and his own ability as a revolutionary leader. Biographer Louis Fischer described him as a lover of radical change and maximum upheaval, a man for whom there was never a middle-ground. He was an either-or, black-or-red exaggerator. Highlighting Lenin's extraordinary capacity for disciplined work and devotion to the revolutionary cause, Pipes noted that he exhibited much charisma. Similarly, Volkogonov believed that by the very force of his personality, Lenin had an influence over people. Conversely, Lenin's friend Gorky commented that in his physical appearance as a baldheaded, stocky, sturdy person, the communist revolutionary was too ordinary and did not give the impression of being a leader.</p>
